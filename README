This website was created for a new Greyhound adoption group in Kentucky. Being as they are a new group, they do not have an active website yet. They have been started to replace Shamrock Greyhound Rescue, which is no longer operating. The idea behind this website is to inform people about Ky Greyhound Rescue and how/why they were started. There will be a "facts" page for visitor's who may not be familiar with the breed. Visitors will be able to see greyhounds that have already been adopted, greyhounds that are available for adoption, as well as a "meet and greet" page. 

To operate this webpage, run the index.html
